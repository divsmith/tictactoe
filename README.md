# Tic Tac Toe
This is a browser based tic tac toe game that I wrote in 2016. It's entirely self contained and runs client side in the browser. It uses HTML and CSS (with Webfonts and transformations) for presentation and Javascript for logic.

# Installation
1. Grab a local copy by running `git clone https://github.com/divsmith/tictactoe.git` in a terminal window. 
2. Doubleclick `index.html` to launch it in your default web browser.
